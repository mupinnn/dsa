/**
 * Diff Two Arrays - Symmetric Difference
 *
 * Compare two arrays and a new array with any items only found
 * in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words,
 * return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.
 *
 * Example:
 * arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 * arr2 = [1, 2, 5, 7]
 * return [3, 4, 5, 7]
 *
 * @param {[]} arr1 - Array of items.
 * @param {[]} arr2 - Array of items.
 * @returns {[]} The symmetric difference between those two arrays.
