/**
 * DNA Pairing
 *
 * The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Take each character,
 * get its pair, and return the results as a 2D array.
 *
 * Base pairs are a pair of AT and CG. Match the missing element to
 * the provided character.
 *
 * Return the provided character as the first element in each array.
 *
 * For example, for input "GCG" return [["G", "C"], ["C","G"], ["G", "C"]].
 * The character and its pair are paired up in an array, and all the arrays
 * are grouped into one encapsulating array.
 *
 * @param {string} str - Base pairs.
 * @returns {string} 2D array of character and its pair.
