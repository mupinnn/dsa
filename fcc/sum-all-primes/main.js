/**
 * Sum All Primes
 *
 * A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors:
 * 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible
 * by 1 and 2 (itself). In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1,
 * 2 and 4.
 *
 * @param {number} num - Any numbers
 * @returns {number} The sum of all prime numbers that are less than
 *                   or equal to `num`.
